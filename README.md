# NBIPs
The NBAI Improvement Proposal  repository
NBAI Improvement Proposals (NBIPs) describe standards for the Ethereum platform, including core protocol specifications, client APIs, and contract standards.

# Contributing

 1. Review  NBIP Readme.
 2. Fork the repository by clicking "Fork" in the top right.
 3. Add your NBIP to your fork of the repository. There is a [template NBIP here](NBIP-template.md).
 4. Submit a Pull Request to NBIP's [NBIPs repository](https://github.com/nebulaai/NBIPs).

Your first PR should be a first draft of the final NBIP. It must meet the formatting criteria enforced by the build (largely, correct metadata in the header). An editor will manually review the first PR for a new EIP and assign it a number before merging it. Make sure you include a `discussions-to` header with the URL to a discussion forum or open GitHub issue where people can discuss the EIP as a whole.

# NBIP Status Terms

* **Draft** - an NBIP that is undergoing rapid iteration and changes.
* **Last Call** - an NBIP that is done with its initial iteration and ready for review by a wide audience.
* **Accepted** - a core NBIP that has been in Last Call for at least 2 weeks and any technical changes that were requested have been addressed by the author. The process for Core Devs to decide whether to encode an EIP into their clients as part of a hard fork is not part of the EIP process. If such a decision is made, the EIP will move to final.
* **Final (non-Core)** - an NBIP that has been in Last Call for at least 2 weeks and any technical changes that were requested have been addressed by the author.
* **Final (Core)** - an NBIP that the Core Devs have decided to implement and release in a future hard fork or has already been released in a hard fork.
